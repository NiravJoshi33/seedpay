# Contributing to SeedPay

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SeedPay! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the protocol specification.

## 🤔 How to Provide Feedback

We welcome feedback from:

- **BitTorrent protocol experts** - Technical correctness, compatibility concerns
- **P2P developers** - Implementation feasibility, edge cases
- **Crypto builders** - Blockchain integration, payment flow improvements
- **Security researchers** - Attack vectors, security considerations
- **End users** - Use case validation, UX concerns

### Ways to Contribute

1. **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs, ask questions, suggest improvements
2. **GitHub Discussions**: Engage in broader conversations about the protocol
3. **Pull Requests**: Propose changes to the specification or documentation
4. **Code Examples**: Share implementation snippets or test vectors

## 📝 Contributing to the Specification

### Areas Needing Input

The following sections are marked as "Draft/TBD" and especially need contributions:

- **Ratio Credits System** (Section 4) - Credit earning, spending, and verification mechanisms
- **Security Considerations** (Section 5) - Payment verification, peer authentication, economic attacks
- **Implementation Notes** (Section 6) - Blockchain integration details, performance considerations
- **Future Extensions** (Section 7) - Multi-chain support, advanced payment models

### Specification Style

When contributing to PROTOCOL.md:

- Use clear, technical language
- Include JSON examples for message formats
- Reference relevant BEPs and standards
- Mark incomplete sections as "Draft/TBD"
- Follow the existing structure and formatting

### Making Changes

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a branch** for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`)
3. **Make your changes** to PROTOCOL.md or other files
4. **Test your markdown** renders correctly
5. **Commit** with a clear message
6. **Push** to your fork
7. **Open a Pull Request** with a description of your changes

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:

- **Type**: Bug, question, enhancement, security concern
- **Section**: Which part of PROTOCOL.md (if applicable)
- **Description**: Clear explanation of the issue
- **Context**: Why this matters or how it affects the protocol

### Issue Labels

We use labels to categorize issues:

- `bug` - Errors or inconsistencies in the specification
- `enhancement` - Proposed improvements
- `question` - Questions about the protocol
- `security` - Security concerns or vulnerabilities
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements
- `draft-section` - Feedback on Draft/TBD sections

## 💡 Proposing Changes

### Small Changes

For minor corrections (typos, clarifications, formatting):

- Open a PR directly
- Include a brief description

### Significant Changes

For substantial protocol changes:

1. **Open a Discussion** first to gather feedback
2. **Describe the problem** you're solving
3. **Propose your solution** with rationale
4. **Wait for community input** before implementing
5. **Create a PR** once there's consensus (or clear direction)

### Breaking Changes

If your change would break backward compatibility or change core protocol behavior:

- **Must** start with a Discussion
- **Must** explain why the breaking change is necessary
- **Must** propose migration path (if applicable)
- **Should** wait for maintainer approval before PR

## 🔍 Review Process

1. **Automated checks** - Markdown formatting, link validation
2. **Community review** - Open for at least 3-5 days
3. **Maintainer review** - Final approval
4. **Merge** - Changes are merged into main

## 📋 Code of Conduct

### Our Standards

- **Be respectful** - Disagreement is fine, personal attacks are not
- **Be constructive** - Focus on improving the protocol
- **Be inclusive** - Welcome contributors of all backgrounds
- **Be patient** - This is a volunteer-driven project

- Publishing others' private information
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## 🎯 Contribution Priorities

While all contributions are welcome, we're especially interested in:

1. **Completing Draft/TBD sections** - Ratio credits, security, implementation notes
2. **Security review** - Identifying vulnerabilities and attack vectors
3. **Implementation examples** - Code snippets, test vectors, reference implementations
4. **Documentation improvements** - Clarifications, diagrams, examples
5. **Use case validation** - Real-world scenarios and requirements
