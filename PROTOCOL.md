# SeedPay: Payments Protocol for BitTorrent Networks

## Seeders earn crypto for sharing files. Leechers pay for faster downloads or earn credits by seeding.

</div>

## Abstract

SeedPay is an open payment protocol that enables BitTorrent seeders to earn cryptocurrency for sharing files, while giving leechers two paths for accessing the content: pay seeders directly with stablecoins (i.g. USDC), or earn ratio credits by seeding other torrents.

By extending the BitTorrent Wire Protocol with payment handshakes and blockchain verified proofs, SeedPay solves the free-rider problem without requiring centralized infrastructure or breaking compatibility with existing clients.

The protocol supports micropayments as low as $0.0001/MB with near-instant settlement, backward compatibility with standard BitTorrent, and optional participation, making it suitable for both public and private swarms.

## 1. Motivation

### The Free-Rider Problem in BitTorrent

BitTorrent's success depends on users seeding (uploading) files after downloading them. However, rational actors have no incentive to continue seeding once their download completes—leading to the "free-rider problem."

**Consequences:**

- Popular torrents thrive (many seeders)
- Long-tail content dies (no seeders after initial interest)
- Download speeds degrade as seeder/leecher ratio drops
- Network relies on altruism, which doesn't scale

### Why Existing Solutions Are Insufficient

**Tit-for-tat (built into BitTorrent):**

- Only works during active download sessions
- No incentive to seed after completion
- Easily gamed by "hit-and-run" users

**Private trackers:**

- Enforce ratio requirements (must seed 1:1 or more)
- Require centralized coordination
- High barrier to entry (invite-only)
- Not viable for public/open content

**BitTorrent Token (BTT):**

- Centralized ledger, proprietary implementation
- Limited adoption, high friction
- Didn't integrate with existing clients

### How SeedPay Solves This

SeedPay provides **direct economic incentives** for seeding through two mechanisms:

1. **Micropayments**: Leechers pay seeders in stablecoins
   ($0.0001-$0.001/MB typical)
2. **Ratio credits**: Leechers earn credits by seeding, spend them
   to download from paid seeders

This dual model:

- Incentivizes seeding after download completion
- Works for both crypto-native and traditional users
- No centralized infrastructure required
- Backward compatible with existing clients
